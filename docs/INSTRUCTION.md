# CHAI Framework: Instruction

The CHAI framework is designed to be applied in an interative design workshop setting, following the reasoning porcess in Fig. 1. All materials are available on our [public Figma board](https://www.figma.com/board/ZAdvuZZbakSogRIwY0U3UY/Public-board?node-id=0-1&t=NTib5kfLvavU3lpl-1) and as PDFs in `workshop_material/`.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Set Up (5 minutes)
1. Open the [public Figma board template](https://www.figma.com/board/ZAdvuZZbakSogRIwY0U3UY/Public-board?node-id=0-1&t=NTib5kfLvavU3lpl-1).
2. Duplicate the board to your own Figma workspace so your team can edit it.
3. Familiarise yourself with the board layout — it is organised by the four stages, with designated areas for each activity.

> **Tip:** If you prefer working offline, download the stage-by-stage PDFs from `workshop_material/` and use sticky notes or a physical whiteboard.

#### Step 2: Assessment — Design Context and Agency Intent (15–20 minutes)
1. Navigate to the **Stage 1** area on the Figma board.
2. **Design recap:** Have each team member briefly describe the project's goals and target users. Capture key points on the board.
3. **System visualisation:** Sketch or paste your system diagram and user flow onto the board. Identify the main components, screens, or interactions.
4. **Agency intent:** Discuss: What does agency mean for the children using your system? Which types of agency matter most? Write down your initial agency goals.

> **Note:** See `Design for Agency Workshop - Stage 1.pdf` if you are running the design workshop offline.

#### Step 3: Mapping — Agency Annotation (15–20 minutes)
1. Navigate to the **Stage 2** area on the Figma board, where you will find the **agency mapping matrix**.
2. **List key functions:** Write your system's key functions along the top row of the matrix.
3. **Annotate agency levels:** For each function, discuss and assign a level (low / medium / high) for each of the four agency types. Use the child's voice statements from the level descriptions to guide your reasoning.
4. **Discuss and justify:** As you annotate, discuss *why* you chose each level. Are there tensions between different agency types? Are some functions more consequential for agency than others?

> **Note:** See `Design for Agency Workshop - Stage 2.pdf` if you are running the design workshop offline.

#### Step 4: Application — Critical Redesign (15–20 minutes)
1. Navigate to the **Stage 3** area on the Figma board.
2. **Identify gaps:** Review your agency map. Where does your current design not meet your target agency levels?
3. **Select a focus:** Choose one or two system functions where agency support is most critical or most misaligned.
4. **Propose redesigns:** Sketch or describe alternative design choices that would better support children's agency. Note the trade-offs involved.

> **Note:** See `Design for Agency Workshop - Stage 3.pdf` if you are running the design workshop offline.

#### Step 5: Reflection — Reasoning Review (10–15 minutes)
1. Navigate to the **Stage 4** area on the Figma board.
2. **Review your journey:** Look back at your work across Stages 1–3. How has your thinking about agency changed?
3. **Surface tensions:** What unresolved tensions or constraints remain? Where do agency goals conflict with other priorities?
4. **Plan next steps:** What would you do differently in your design? What further investigation is needed?

> **Note:** See `Design for Agency Workshop - Stage 4.pdf` if you are running the design workshop offline.

### After the Workshop

- **Save your board.** Your annotated Figma board is a valuable design artefact — it captures your team's reasoning and can be revisited in future design iterations.
- **Iterate.** The CHAI framework supports iterative reasoning — you can return to any stage as your design evolves.
